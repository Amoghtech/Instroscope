# Instroscope

A Flutter App where retailers can sell Medicinal Instruments or other patients can help another by giving information about various Medicinal Instruments that are required in checking up a particular disease.
As There's a lack of awareness about various instruments that can help patients to identify which kind of disease they are suffering from, this App will act as a bridge to connect them.


I have suffered the same kind of situation so I'm coming up with this idea.

Snapshots coming soon...
